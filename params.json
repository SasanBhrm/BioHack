{"name":"Biohack","tagline":"The Bio, BioHack, BioLab Equipment Fabrication and Biomaterilas done in BioHack Academy ","body":"### Welcome to BioHack Pages.\r\nBioHack \r\nIn this research project we have made our best effort to create open source Bio Lab, which equipped with Biolab equipment and start Bio projects in that lab, some of the devices we have made include : magnetic stirrer, sterile hood, Syringe Pump, Peristaltic Pump, Centrifuge(Bio Centrifuge), Incubator and etc, \r\nOf the project we have done was growing different bacteria, Cultivating and Isolating Microbes (like leaf, Mycelium,  MG , etc,. ) , make electricity out of nutrient soil, water cleaning Bio Reacotor with Algae, and Designing Microfluidics Chip, \r\nThe Biohack academy itself contains more than just one project itself that could be explained as one research project.\r\n2015\r\n![](http://sasanbahrami.webnode.com/images/200000013-4f642505d5/IMG_5780.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Magnetic Stirrer\r\n\r\nThis was one of the project I really love, since we ourselves have used it a lot, This contain an electronic circuit which contain motor and fan and connected to series of resistors and switches and, as of fabricated with fan, we have connected to magnets on the fan the those causes the moment of rods.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000025-b63deb7393/IMG_5106.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATOR\r\nin out Bio Factory wa have made Incubator which contain timing machine designed by electronic components and Arduino and timing module and tempreture sensor, it contain light bulp to make heating and computer fan to make circulation of air, this the hacked version of every normal lab incubator, \r\n\r\nThe design has been done by us in Bio lab and we have used sketchup and laser cutter to design although other tools like inkspace has been used and the fabrication made with MDF.\r\n\r\nAs of usage we have make out bateria growth and cultivation with this incubator, and t was lovely to work with.I\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://sasanbahrami.webnode.com/images/200000024-7862179589/incubator-.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000033-22bbd23b58/Forked-Incubator.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentrifuge\r\n\r\nThis is our centrifuge project which we had made a great effort to make its electronics, \r\n\r\nwe have also fabricate it as to parts one of been sides and box which as been design in sketches the laser cut, \r\n\r\nthe second import part was its Rotor which has been designed and fabricated with a 3D Printer and there has been second Rotor which has been done in wood work (Actually we have made two rotors)\r\n\r\n![](http://sasanbahrami.webnode.com/images/200000026-628a66388b/bio-centri-fab-outside-raw.jpg)\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000028-187ed197b6/bio-Centri.jpg)\r\n\r\nthis the 3d print rotor for centri\r\n\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000032-1461216512/IMG_5368trimmed.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Here is the Hodd we fabricate:'\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000116-77a0478985/streelllll-hood.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project that I focused on in the lab was Microfluidics\r\n\r\nProposed different approaches of Microfluidics chip fabrication other than typical PDMS, the alternatives are both low cost and easy to fabricate, Among ordinary methodologies, fabrication of PlexiGlass with Laser Cutter, molding with Agar and molded Silicone Oil with Laser cut PlexiGlass mask have been observed and also fully designed chip with PlexiGlass and Ethanol bonding and finally two sided silicone with Plexiglas covers has been tested\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/system_preview_detail_200000004-bf4a7c13fc/flowing-silicon-m-c.jpg)\r\n\r\n![](http://files.sasanbahrami.webnode.com/200000060-1166f125fb/m-cap-flow-c-2.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
